How to Introduce Characters in Your Writing
Good writing is filled with memorable character introductions.
Here is some writing advice to help you introduce your characters 
as effectively as possible:

Don’t get bogged down in physical appearance. When it comes to 
character introductions, it’s tempting to focus on physical character
descriptions. However, rather than telling the reader that your 
character has brown hair and blue eyes, focus on describing 
a character’s personality and actions. Those details are more likely
to capture your readers’ attention than rote descriptions of 
physical appearance. Use your reader’s imagination to your 
advantage: If you allow the reader to fill in their own physical 
details like height and eye color, that character is more likely
to stick in the reader’s mind.

Give your character a memorable character trait. 
Though it’s unwise to spend a ton of time describing mundane
physical details, giving your characters memorable character 
traits or mannerisms early in the writing process can help you 
create distinct, instantly memorable characters. Including traits 
or mannerisms in your own story can help the reader differentiate
between characters and gain insight into a character’s self-image. 
Old men who strain to have good posture despite their age might
suggest that they value the appearance of formality and high 
status above all else. In a thriller, readers might infer that
a character who insists on facing the door when sitting is used
to being in danger.
Start with backstory when appropriate. W
